The latest version is 2.8.3 from October 2023. See [NewFeatures283](/p/jforum2/wiki2/NewFeatures283/) for a full list of improvements
compared to the previous version. All users should upgrade. A Java 8 JVM and a Servlet 3.1 container is required.

If you want to use the as-yet-unreleased features mentioned in [NewFeaturesTrunk](/p/jforum2/wiki2/NewFeaturesTrunk/),
you'll have to download the source code and build the war file yourself.

A pre-release build for JakartaEE 10 is also available in the Files area (jforum-2.9.0b1.war). It needs Java 11 and Tomcat 10.1 to run on.
Its functionality is on a par with 2.8.3, plus everything mentioned in NewFeaturesTrunk.
It is functional, but has not had as much testing as previous versions of JForum. Let us know if you notice anything unusual.
